Sciences Models to Social Phenomena.
All models are implemented with Python.


## Schelling's Model of Segregation

Implementation of Schelling's Model of Segregation that helps explain why social segregation is difficult to combat. 
The model is built of a grid, representing a town, in which each cell can either be occupied by an agent of type A or type B or empty. In each round every agent looks at his neighbors and decides to move to an empty cell if the ratio of his neighbors that aren't of his type is above some threshold. 
The model shows that segregation are formed very quickly and even when setting the threshold higher or introducing other incitements for agents to be more tolerant, the segregation is difficult to break. 

Implemented with Python and some insights are made possible using matplotlib graphs and visualizations.

## Epstein's model of Generalized Rebellion Against Central Authority

Implementation of Epstein's model describing how certain factors (authority enforcement, legitimacy and punishment levels) can affect the rebellion frequency. 

The implementation offers graphs that help understanding how each parameter can affect the rebellion level.
