## Schelling's Model of Segregation

Implementation of Schelling's Model of Segregation that helps explain why social segregation is difficult to combat. 
The model is built of a grid, representing a town, in which each cell can either be occupied by an agent of type A or type B or empty. In each round every agent looks at his neighbors and decides to move to an empty cell if the ratio of his neighbors that aren't of his type is above some threshold. 
The model shows that segregation are formed very quickly and even when setting the threshold higher or introducing other incitements for agents to be more tolerant, the segregation is difficult to break. 

Implemented with Python and some insights are made possible using matplotlib graphs and visualizations.
